## What is Uni PosBridge?

Uni PosBridge is a service for exchanging tokens between blockchain networks. This increases interoperability between blockchains. Specifically here we can convert digital assets between Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Unichain networks. Thanks to that, users can use digital assets such as UNW, ETH... on the Binance network or BNB, USDT... on the Unichain network.

By using the [Uni Bridge portal](https://posbridge.unichain.world/), you can access the liquidity chain on Unichain with just a few tasks.
