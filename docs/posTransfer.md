## Wrap Transfer: "Deposit" and "Withdraw"

The “Deposit” feature allows you to convert from the blockchain’s native token to the Unichain. Conversely, “Withdraw” allows you to convert from Unichain tokens to blockchain native tokens.

To complete Deposit, you will first need a compatible wallet, such as [Unichain Wallet](https://developers.unichain.world/docs/wallet) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

Select the string you want to convert, and then enter the amount. Uni PosBridge will specify your address to which you must deposit funds. You will have a certain amount of time to recharge to that address. If you send funds to the address during that time, Uni PosBridge will send you an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens to your Unichain address. You can see step-by-step instructions on how to do this in How to Get Started with Uni PosBridge.

Once the transaction is complete, Uni PosBridge will lock the token and anchoring to the Unichain is complete. This is when you can start using wrap tokens.

You should start with small amount before making larger trades.

After converting, your wrap token is circulated in the Unichain with the same value as the original token, you can use this token for different purposes.
