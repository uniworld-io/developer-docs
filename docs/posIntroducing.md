## Introducing 
Currently, there is a small problem in the crypto space. Different blockchains cannot talk to each other. If you do a Bitcoin or Ether transaction, the Uni blockchain won't be able to know it's happening. If we look a little further and look to the future, this problem may be solved somehow through new technology. However, a much faster solution currently available is coin wrapped and token wrapped.

Wrapped tokens allow you to use coins and native tokens of other blockchains as tokens on another chain, such as Unichain. We have seen how this solution can work with BNB tokenized on Unichain. The Uni PosBridge project introduces this idea to Unichain.
