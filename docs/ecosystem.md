[UniWorld](https://uniworld.io) has many products that have been golived already. All of them form the ecosystem and link together. Some popular products as below

- [UniBot](https://www.paphussolutions.com/): An AI and chatbot platform utilizing UniChain for verification and store transactions. Users can create and customize their own chatbots
- [UniMe](https://about.unime.world/): Mobile app which can be used as a secure end-to-end chat app (also supports audio/video calls). It also acts as a Blockchain hub where users can manage their Blockchain wallets (currently UNW, ETH and  BNB - more are planned) or just simply use it to enter or scan codes (including QR) and track a product origin (supply chain/storage/verification use-case)
- [Mia social network](https://mia.world/): Similar to other social platforms but focused on AI, Blockchain and the Smart Society 5.0. It uses UniChain to permanently store transactions and also rewards users (in UNW) for good content.
- UniKid: It's none-profit product that helps the kids to learn the basic concept of programing and control the bot
- UniCool: The VR game so that users can get the coin/token like catching the pokemon in Pokemon go.
- And of course, the [UniChain](https://unichain.world).
