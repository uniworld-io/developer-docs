## Introducing 
Currently, there is a small problem in the crypto space. Different blockchains cannot talk to each other. If you do a Bitcoin or Ether transaction, the Uni blockchain won't be able to know it's happening. If we look a little further and look to the future, this issue may be solved somehow through new technology. However, a much faster solution currently available is coin wrapped and token wrapped.

Wrapped tokens allow you to use coins and native tokens of other blockchains as tokens on another chain, such as Unichain. We have seen how this solution can work with BNB tokenized on Unichain. The Uni PosBridge project introduces this idea to Unichain.


## What is Uni Bridge?

Uni PosBridge is a service for exchanging tokens between blockchain networks. This increases interoperability between blockchains. Specifically here we can convert digital assets between Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Unichain networks. Thanks to that, users can use digital assets such as UNW, ETH... on the Binance network or BNB, USDT... on the Unichain network.

By using the [Uni Bridge portal](https://testnet.unibridge.world/), you can access the liquidity chain on Unichain with just a few tasks.
