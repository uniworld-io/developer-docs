## UNW

UNW (UniWorld Token) is the native coin on the UniChain network, just like ETH on Ethereum. Unlike other networks, UNW can not be mined. It’s distributed from UniWorld organization - the founder of UniChain and born via network rewards. 
The total supply of UNW is 1.000.000.000 (in word: one billion) and the coin in curriculum is 300.000.000 UNW.
The coin born in network rewards will be balanced with the coin burnt from network activities (transaction fee, deploy smart contract, issue token …) and the inflation rate should be nearly zero percent.

The smallest unit of UNW is Ginza. 1 UNW = 1.000.000 Ginza

## How to obtain UNW

Because UNW cannot be mined. You can obtain UNW from UniWorld airdrop/bounty campaigns, swap from other coins/token or buy from exchanges. You also join the network and get the rewards (become a witness or vote for witness)

## Tokens

Tokens are simply digital assets that are being built on top of the blockchain platform (for example UniChain, EOS, ETH ...). They benefit from blockchain's existing infrastructure instead of developers having to build an entirely new blockchain. Currently, UniChain supports these types of token: URC, URC-20, URC-20 Native, URC-30 Native and URC-721 Native token.
- URC token is the build-in token on UniChain network, It's very easy to create with simple functions including *create token*, *transfer token* and *swap token (UNW to tokens)*. This token is mostly deprecated and replaced by URC-30
- URC-20 token is the extension of UNC token. User's can defined more business logics by using the smart contract system (for example: lock the token, transfer with condition ...).
- URC-20 Native token is a token built on top of UVM, compatible with Ethereum ERC-20 so that users can create, transfer, exchange...
- URC-30 Native token is a token built on top of UVM so that users can create, transfer, exchange ... seamlessly without any smart contracts.
- URC-721 Native token is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) built on top of UVM, compatible with Ethereum ERC-721 so that users can create, transfer, exchange NFT assets...
