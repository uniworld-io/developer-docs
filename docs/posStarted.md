## How to Get Started With Uni PoBridge
### 1. Install wallet
First make sure you have [metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) and [uniwallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uniwallet/glifbmajcmgbjkeklllabmmpbgecnmnn?hl=vi) wallet installed.

The next step is to create a wallet address on metamask and uniwallet, if you already have a wallet address, you can skip this step.

### 2. Connect wallet
Please visit [Uni PosBridge](https://posbridge.unichain.world/).

Next choose network and connect your wallet:

After successfully connecting the wallet, the screen will display your wallet address as follows:
![pos_new_transfer](../img/pos_new_transfer.png)

The next, select `Begin new transfer` to start wrap the token.

### 3. Deposit transfer

In step 2 you chose `Begin new transfer`, everything looks like this:

This means you will have to convert tokens from Binance network to Unichain, for deposit you choose a native token like BNB or BUSD...

Uni PosBridge will show the address of token on the root network, so you can be sure that the exact token you want to convert.

Finally, fill the amount you want to convert and click `Continue`

### 4. Withdraw transfer

As we mentioned in step 3, when you "deposit" tokens from the original network here, which is Binance chain, Uni PosBridge will immediately generate the number of wrap tokens on the Unichain network. So to convert wrap token to original token you need to "withdraw".

The steps are similar to "deposit", looks like this:

![pos_withdraw_01](../img/pos_withdraw_01.png)

Pay attention to the marker, this means you are doing a token conversion from the Unichain network back to the Binance chain.

This token address is not the same as at step 3 because here is a wrap token address on network Unichain.

Finally, fill the amount you want to convert and select `continue`.
