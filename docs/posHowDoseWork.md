## How dose Uni PosBridge work ? 

Wrapping a coin or token into a Unichain instance is actually quite simple. By using the Uni PosBridge service, you can convert crypto assets between the native blockchain and the Unichain. For example, if you transfer BUSD from Binance Chain to Unichain, Uni PosBridge will support Ethereum ERC-20 or Binance BEP-20 cross-chain conversion to Uni [URC-20](https://developers.unichain.world/docs/unichainToken). It is worth noting that these wrapped coins are backed by real coins and tokens on public addresses.

Currently, the Uni PosBridge Project supports [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) cross-chain transfers. As you may already know, ERC-20 and ERC-721 is an extremely popular token standard on Ethereum.

After you have set the parameters, the conversion time is quite short and it will take you about 10-30s to do the cross-chain conversion. Of course, this depends on the confirmation time of the blockchain network. What does that mean? Depending on the blockchain you are trying to convert, this may take longer during times of network congestion and heavy traffic.

Uni RosBridge provides completely free service. You only pay network transaction fees on the blockchains you are converting.
